JSInfiniteScrollView
====================

Using this scrollView class you can implement horizontal dial control.

An infinitely scrolling (or wrapping) scroll view. You provide the views and it allows you to scroll in one direction forever without ever hitting and end.

This is fork from jasarien project. Thanks for making this possible!
this fork includes additional features so it's not compatible with original project.

Infinite scrollView with three unique features combined 
------------------------

- Infinite "wrap-around" scrolling
- Dynamic creation and reallocation of sub-views. Important if you have large dataset.
- Extended hit area: show left and right items. Renders +2 next and previous views.

There are other interesting scrollview projects but none of them combines all of the above.

UITableView Inspired API
------------------------

- Set the data source and implement the JSInfiniteScrollViewDataSource protocol
	- Implement `-numberOfViewsInInfiniteScrollView:`
	- Implement `-infiniteScrollView:viewForIndex:`
- Optionally set a delegate
	- Implement `-infiniteScrollView:didScrollToViewAtIndex:`
- Call `-reloadData:` if your data source changes.
